Event Handling Basics
	Based on Previous presentations you should already
		understand the purpose of jQuery and the basic jQuery syntax
		be able to use jQuery to make modify the DOM after the page is ready 
	At the end of this presentation you should 
		know what type of events can be handled
		be able to use jQuery to write event handlers for those events

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Event overview
	Events are things that happen to or on a web page
	A Complete list of the the standard events in the DOM can be found in the jQuery documentation here:
		[[http://api.jquery.com/Types/#Event!http://api.jquery.com/Types/#Event]]
	The left column of the jQuery API Documentation lists general categories, one of which is Events
	The [[Events!http://api.jquery.com/category/events/]] sub-categories are
		Browser
		Document Loading
		Event Handler Attachment
		Form Events
		Keyboard Events
		Mouse Events	
---------------------------------------------
Attaching event handlers
	The syntax for attaching event handlers is identical to running other jQuery functions
	For example, to attache a "click" event handler to a button, you could do this:
		[[code]]
		$('#someButton').click( ... );
	But the click function will need an agument, and that argument will be a function.
	So we'll replace the ... with the following function:
	[[code]]
		function() {
			alert("Blastoff!!!");
		}
	Which will give is this code:
		[[code]]
		$('#someButton').click(function(){
			alert("You clicked the button!");
		});
	That may look complex, but it's typical jQuery, and the individual parts are fairly simple
---------------------------------------------------------------------		
Events		
	Common events that are handled (by category) are:
		[[Mouse!https://api.jquery.com/category/events/mouse-events/]]
			click, dblclick
			mouseover, mouseout, mousemove
			[[and others
		[[Keyboard!https://api.jquery.com/category/events/keyboard-events/]]
			keypress
			keydown, keyup
		[[Document!https://api.jquery.com/category/events/document-loading/]]
			load, ready, unload
		[[Browser Window!https://api.jquery.com/category/events/browser-events/]]
			resize, scroll 
		[[Form!https://api.jquery.com/category/events/form-events/]]
			submit, change, focus, blur
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Practice
	For each event categories		
		Use jsFiddle or a web page to try out some of the mouse and keyboard events
			At a minium, try out the following
				a few of the shortcut function (click, mousedown, etc..)
				on and off
