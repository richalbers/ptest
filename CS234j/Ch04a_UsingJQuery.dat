Using jQuery on a Webpage
	At the end of this presentation you should 
		know the differences in the major jQuery versions
		know where and how to obtain a jQuery library
		know the advantages and disadvantages of using a local copy vs one in the cloud 
		be able to use jQuery properly on a webpage
---------------------------------------------
Getting jQuery library
	To use jQuery you need to include the jQuery library in your code
		You can [[download your own copy or link to a version hosted on-line!http://docs.jquery.com/Downloading_jQuery]]
	Based on that info, you should know:
		What's the purpose of jQuery?
		What's the difference between:
				jquery-1.11.0.min.js
				jquery-1.11.0.js
			And why would you use one over the other?
		What's the difference between jQuery 1.x and 2.x?
		What's the jQuery migrate plugin for?
		What's a CDN?
			And what are the advantages of using a CDN?
-------------------------------------------
Document.ready Event
	You can't start using JQuery functions to interact with the document until the DOM has been completely built.
	The JQuery object has a ready() event associated with the document that is triggered when we're ready for liftoff
		[[code]]
		$(document).ready(function(){
			alert("Blastoff!!!");
			// or lots of other code...
		});
	There should be NO jQuery code ran until the document is ready
	The $(document).ready() event handler can contain lots of other code and/or call other functions
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Practice
	Create the following files
		demo.html
		demo.css
		demo.js
	In the demo.html 
		link to a version of jQuery from a CDN
		link to demo.js 
		Add a body with some buttons, headers, and paragraphs
	In the demo.js file
		When the document is ready, print an alert message
		When that works, replace the alert message with code that
			attaches event handlers to the buttons so when they're clicked other elements change in some way (style and/or content)
