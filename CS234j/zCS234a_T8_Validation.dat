Form Validation

-----------------------------------------------------------
Overview
	Data validation is the process of ensuring that a program operates on clean, correct and useful data
	All data coming from the user must be validated
	Why?
		Operation typically depends on data
			Bad data can result in unexpected operation
		Making sure data is valid up-front makes for easier coding when dealing with the data (less error handling code needed througout program)
		Putting bad data into a database can have lots of unintended consequences later on
			ALWAYS VALIDATE DATA GOING INTO A DATABASE

-----------------------------------------------------------
When/Where/How
	When?
		Two possibilities
			When user leaves field
			When submit is pressed
	Where?
		Client side
			faster response time
			less network traffic
		Server side
			Can't be bypassed
		I'd recommend both for data going into database
	How? (on client)
		HTML5
		Custom Javascript
		Using a JQuery plugin

-----------------------------------------------------------
HTML5
	HTML5 provides built in validation
	Implemented using [[new input field types/attributes!http://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_form_input_types.asp]]
	Pros
		Very simple to implement
		Covers common things
	Cons
		Not universally supported 
		Can't validate based on data from server
		Difficult to combine with custom validation and achieve same look and feel
	
-----------------------------------------------------------
Custom Javascript
	You can write javascript to validate
		fields when you leave them
			onblur event (.blur() in JQuery)
		or the entire form when you push submit 
			set form onsubmit attribute to validation function
				if it returns false, action is NOT done
				if it returns true, action is done
	Pros
		Is entirely under your control
		All things are possible
	Cons
		Requires a fair amount of code (relative to the other solutions)
			You need to write validation routines
			You need to create way to display/clear error messages
-----------------------------------------------------------
Using a JQuery Plugin
	There have been numerous jQuery plugins written to provide validation
	In their simplest form, you just put input elements into classes based on the type of validation you want done on each
	More flexible ones allow you to specify "rules" to apply to different fields
	Pros
		Relatively Easy to use
		Customizable (usually)
	Cons
		documentation might be lacking 
	The most popular example:
