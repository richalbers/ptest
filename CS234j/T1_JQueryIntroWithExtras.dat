JQuery Overview
	At the end of this presentation you should
		know what jQuery is for
		understand the basic jQuery syntax
		know all the different types of selectors that can be used
		be able to use a few simple jQuery functions
		understand what event handlers are
		be able to attach event handers to elements
------------------------------------------
What is jQuery?
	JQuery is a library of javascript functions
	It simplifies
		element attribute and style manipulation
		event handling
		animations
		ajax
		handling browser differences
		completely separating your javascript from your html
	We'll look at each of those in order
-------------------------------------------
Overview
	jQuery is object oriented. 
		There's a jQuery object and it builds objects representing elements in the DOM.  
	jQuery function calls have the following syntax
		[[code]]
		jQuery(selector).jQ_function(arguments);
			or more simply
		$(selector).jQ_function(arguments);
		// $ is short for jQuery!
	Selectors are most standard css selectors and more!
	There are numerous functions
	Some simple examples:
		[[code]]
		$('p').html("censored"); //replaces paragraph text 
		$('p').css("color", "red"); //makes paragraphs red

Selectors
	JQuery selectors can be most CSS selectors + many many more! 
	A concise list is on w3schools
		[[http://www.w3schools.com/jquery/jquery_ref_selectors.asp!http://www.w3schools.com/jquery/jquery_ref_selectors.asp]]
	All the details are on JQuery.com
		[[http://api.jquery.com/category/selectors/!http://api.jquery.com/category/selectors/]]
		
------------------------------------------------
Figure it out!
	What selector would match
		all h1 elements
		the element who's id is #bob?
		all elements whose class is .zoo
		all h1, h2, and h3 elements
		all header elements (h1-h6)
		all elements who's class is .zoo or .boo
		all paragraph elements who's class is .boo
		the h1 elements inside an element who's id is #s1
		all the even li elements
		all the even li elements in an element who's id is #s2
		all empty elements
------------------------------------------------
Test it
	Use [[jsFiddle!jsfiddle.net]] to try out all the previous selectors
		Tell it to use jQuery 1.11
		In the html section, enter the html as it would be in the body
			An h1 element
			two sections, with id's of s1 and s2
			in each section:
				An h2 element
				two paragraphs 
				an ordered list 
			put a few items in the classes .zoo or .boo
			give one paragraph the id #bob
		In the javascript section put the jQuery code to select all the items on the previous page and turn each some color
			$( selector ).css("color", "red");

Functions
	There are hundreds of functions
		If you can think of something you might want to do to an element, there's a function for it!
		There are functions to
			get/change an elements contents
			get/change an elements attributes
			get/change an elements style or class
			insert/delete elements
			animate elements
			and more!
	Most useful is learning how to use the documentation to find and use new-to-you functions
		That skill will allow your knowledge bank to grow continually

---------------------------------------------
Some Simple Functions
	Use the JQuery documentation to figure out how to:
		Change the contents of an element (.html)
		Changing styles (.css)
		Putting/removing an element from a class
	And use [[jsFiddle!jsfiddle.net]] to try out all the previous functions
		You'll need to enter some small amout of code in the javascript, css, and javascript sections

Event Handlers
	Things that happen on the page, or to elements on the page, are called events
	Event Examples
		Page is loaded
		Button is clicked
		Mouse rolls over an element
		many others...
	Code can be run when events occur.  
		This programming model is called "event driven". It's very common.  All applications with a GUI (Graphical User Interface) use it. 
------------------------------------------------
jQuery Events
	jQuery can easily attach/detach event handlers to the page or elements on page 
		This has the benifit of removing ALL javascript from the html file, completely separating page functionality from content
	Ideally
		.html contains only structure and content
		.css file contains ALL style information
		.js contains all functionality
	jQuery had many functions related to events
---------------------------------------------
Attaching event handlers
	The syntax for attaching event handlers is identical to running other jQuery functions
	For example, to attache a "click" event handler to a button, you could do this:
		[[code]]
		$('#someButton').click( ... );
	But the click function will need an agument, and that argument will be a function.
	So we'll replace the ... with the following function:
	[[code]]
		function() {
			alert("Blastoff!!!");
		}
	Which will give is this code:
		[[code]]
		$('#someButton').click(function(){
			alert("You clicked the button!");
		});
	That may look complex, but it's typical jQuery, and the individual parts are fairly simple
---------------------------------------------
Test it
	Use [[jsFiddle!jsfiddle.net]] to attach a .click event handler to a button so when the button is pressed a message pops up.
	Then make another button that when pressed changes a different element turn green.
	You'll need to enter some small amout of code in the javascript, css, and javascript sections

---------------------------------------------
Getting jQuery library
	To use jQuery you need to include the jQuery library in your code
		You can [[download your own copy or link to a version hosted on-line!http://docs.jquery.com/Downloading_jQuery]]
	Based on that info, you should know:
		What's the purpose of jQuery?
		What's the difference between:
				jquery-1.11.0.min.js
				jquery-1.11.0.js
			And why would I use one over the other?
		What's the difference between jQuery 1.x and 2.x?
		What's the jQuery migrate plugin for?
		What's a CDN?
			And what are the advantages of using a CDN?

-------------------------------------------
Getting Started
	You can't start using JQuery functions to interact with the document until the DOM has been completely built.
	The JQuery object has a ready() event associated with the document that is triggered when we're ready for liftoff
		[[code]]
		$(document).ready(function(){
			alert("Blastoff!!!");
		});
	That syntax, while possibly confusing at first glance, is typical JQuery.
	It actually contains a selector & function
		[[code]]
		$(document).ready( ... );
	and the argument is another (anonymous) function
		[[code]]
		function() {
			alert("Blastoff!!!");
		}

Class Exercise
	Create drop down menu system
		content (html), presentation (css), and functionality (javascipt) will be completely separate.
