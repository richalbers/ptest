Visual Effects with jQuery
	At the end of this presentation you should be able to
		describe kinds of visual effects that are most common on web pages (and therefore made the easiest to accomplish)
		make elements slide and fade into and out of sight
		make other css styles progress from one value to another
		chain animation effects together
		have a function execute after an animation has completed 
		interrupt an animation in progress

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Overview
	jQuery allows you to add nice visual efffects to your page via several animation functions
		sliding and fading are common so very-easy-to-use routines are provided for those
		animate() allows you to create a custom effects that transitions one or more styles (size, position, opacity, etc..) to a specified value
	Animations can be chained together so one runs after the other.
	A routine can be configured to run when the animation is complete
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Visual Effects Functions
	Simple (fading/sliding)
		hide/show/toggle - hides/shows elements (fading/sliding is optional)
		slideDown/Up/Toggle - slides elements up/down
		fadeIn/Out/To/Toggle - fades elements in/out
	More complex 
		animate - transitions specified styles to specified values
			Doesn't automatically hide elements when animiation is complete
	Effects control
		stop - stops the currently running animations
		finish - instantly completes currently running and queued animations
		delay - delays execution of subsequent functions in chain

Practice
	Use [[jsFiddle!http://http://jsfiddle.net/]] to write code that demonstrates
		fadeIn/Out/Toggle
			fading an element out when a button is pressed
			fading the element in when another button is pressed
			alternatively hiding/showing a paragraph when a button is pressed
		slideIn/Out/Toggle (just as with fade)
		delay, stop, finish
		custom effects using animate
