XML Basics
	At the end of this presentation you should be able to:
		Explain what XML is and what it is used for
		Explain the XML formatting rules
		Create a properly formatted XML file to describe a given dataset
		Use jQuery to fetch an XML file and access it's individual elements and thier attributes
-----------------------------------------------------------
Introduction
	XML
		stands for eXtensible Markup Language
		is a markup langauge to encode data
		has no pre-defined tags
		is designed to be self-descriptive
		is both human and machine readable
		is the X in AJAX
	Data sent from one computer to another can be formatted as XML
------------------------------------------------------------
XML Format
	XML uses tags to define the data
		Opening and closing tags go around the data
		Tags can have attributes
	An example:
	[[code]]
		&lt;?xml version="1.0"?&gt;
		&lt;states&gt;
			&lt;state&gt;
				&lt;name big="no"&gt;Oregon&lt;/name&gt;
				&lt;capital&gt;Salem&lt;/capital&gt;
			&lt;/state&gt;
			&lt;state&gt;
				&lt;name big="yes"&gt;California&lt;/name&gt;
				&lt;capital&gt;Sacremento&lt;/capital&gt;
			&lt;/state&gt;
		&lt;/states&gt;
-----------------------------------------------------------------
XML Rules
	The XML Syntax Rules are as follows:
		All XML elements must have a closing tag.
		XML tags are case sensitive (ideally all lower-case)
		All XML elements must be properly nested.
		All XML documents must have a root element.
		Attribute values must always be quoted.
	An XML document that adheres to those rules is considered "[[well formed!http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-formed_document]]"
	[[http://www.w3schools.com/xml/xml_syntax.asp!http://www.w3schools.com/xml/xml_syntax.asp]] provides examples of XML that follows the rules
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Practice
	Create a XML file containing book info for a single book
		File should be named book.xml
		Information should consist of title, author, ISBN, and if the book is in print
	Create a XML file containing book info for several books
		File should be named books.xml
		Information for each book should consist of title, author, ISBN, and if the book is in print
-----------------------------------------------------------
Parsing XML
	jQuery can parse XML-formatted data into a object similar to the DOM, and then process it using jQuery functions typically used to process the DOM.
		.parseXML() is a jQuery function that parses XML text and creates a valid XML document.
		When the AJAX functions are used to fetch an XML file, they automatically parse the returned data just as .parseXML() would have done.	
	Be aware the XML-parsed object is not like the JSON-parsed object, it's more like the DOM
	w3schools has a [[diagram of the resulting tree!http://www.w3schools.com/Dom/]]
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Working with XML using jQuery
	The following example
		fetches an XML file
		automatically parses it into a jQuery object 
		uses find() to get specific nodes
		uses text() and attr() to get data and attributes from nodes
	Example that processes an XML file formatted as shown on the XML Format slide 
		[[code]]
		$.get( "states.xml", function( xmlData ) {	[[desc Fetches an xml file named states.xml<br>Parses the xml text into a jQuery document object which can be traversed (and manipulated) much like the DOM]]
			$(xmlData).find("state").each( function() { [[desc find returns an array of state elements (there are several)<br>each() calls a function for each item in the array]]
				alert("state found!");
				alert( $(this).find("name").text() );	[[desc Finds the name element that is a child of this state element<br>The text of the element is the state name]]
				alert( $(this).find("name").attr("big") ); [[desc Finds the name element's big attribute ]]
			}); //each
		}); //get
	Note: mouseover each line to get a more detailed description of the line
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Practice
	Create a web page that fetches and parses the XML file of book information you created in the previous practice
