JSONP Basics
	At the end of this presentation you should be able to:
		Explain what the "same origin policy" is
		Explain how JSONP circumvents that policy
		Use JQuery to make JSONP requests
-----------------------------------------------------------
Introduction
	AJAX requests are subject to a "same origin policy".
	For security reasons AJAX requests can only be made to the same server that the page making the AJAX request was downloaded from.
	
	
If the URL includes the string "callback=?" (or similar, as defined by the server-side API), the request is treated as JSONP instead.
