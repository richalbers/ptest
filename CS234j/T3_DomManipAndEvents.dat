Digging deeper - DOM Manipulation and Events
	Based on Previous presentations you should already
		Understand the purpose of jQuery and the basic jQuery syntax
		Be able to use jQuery to make simple page changes after the page is ready 
	At the end of this presentation you should 
		Know the kinds of functions available for manipulating the DOM
		Know what type of events can be handled
		Be able to use the jQuery documentation to quickly find the details on the function
			you need to use to accomplish a specific DOM Manipulation task
			you need to use to handle the event you want to handle
		Use the details from the documentation to write the code to accomplish your task

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Overview
	The jQuery API Documentation provides details and Examples on all jQuery functions
		It's improbable you'll memorize the details on all of them
		But to be effective/effecient, is useful to know
			what can be done
			how the find the details about how to accomplish what you want to do relatively quickly
		To achieve that we'll
			get an overview of many essential (i.e. commonly used) functions
			learn how to use the documentation to get the needed details
	The basic categories of jQuery functions that are used all the time are
		DOM Manipulation - functions to change the web page 
		Events - functions to handle events
---------------------------------------------------------------------
this and chaining
	And now, a minor diversion....
	Two commonly-used features of jQuery, that you'll often see in the documentation, are
		the "this" selector
		chaining
	this - a keyword that selects the element for which the event handler was called.
		For example:
			[[code]]
			//make any paragraph that is clicked on red
			$('p').click( function() {
				$(this).css("color","red");
			});
	Chaining - Once an element has been selected, you can call multiple functions on it
		for example:
			[[code]]
			//chaining demo, call .css() and .html() for an element
			$("#someID").css("color","red").html("I'm now red!")
---------------------------------------------------------------------
DOM Manipulation
	The right column of the jQuery API Documentation lists general categories, one of which is Manipulation
	The [[Manipulation!http://api.jquery.com/category/manipulation/]] sub-categories are
		Class Attribute
		Copying
		DOM Insertion, Around
		DOM Insertion, Inside
		DOM Insertion, Outside
		DOM Removal
		DOM Replacement
		General Attributes
		Style Properties
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Practice
	For each DOM Manipulation category
		Read the short description of what each of the DOM Manipulation Functions does
		Use jsFiddle or a web page to try out a few of the functions to see how they work

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Events
	Common events that are handled (by category) are:
		Mouse
			click, dblclick
			mouseenter, mouseleave
		Keyboard
			keypress
			keydown, keyup
		Form
			submit, change, focus, blur
		Document
			load, unload
		Window
			resize, scroll
	A Complete list of the the standard events in the DOM can be in the jQuery documentation here:
		[[http://api.jquery.com/Types/#Event!http://api.jquery.com/Types/#Event]]
	
----------------------------------------------------------------------
JQuery Event functions
	The right column of the jQuery API Documentation lists general categories, one of which is Events
	The [[Events!http://api.jquery.com/category/events/]] sub-categories are
		Browser
		Document Loading
		Event Handler Attachment
		Form Events
		Keyboard Events
		Mouse Events
	You should look over the functions in each category to see what functionality is provided.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Practice
	For each event categories		
		Read the short description of what each of the DOM Manipulation Functions does
		Use jsFiddle or a web page to try out some of the mouse and keyboard events
			At a minium, try out the following
				a few of the shortcut function (click, mousedown, etc..)
				on and off
