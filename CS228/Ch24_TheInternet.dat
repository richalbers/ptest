Overview
	Internet is the global network of interconnected computers
	Utilizes the TCP/IP protocol
	Large companies provide high-speed backbone
	Smaller companines provide regional service
	ISP (Internet Service Provider) provides customers access to the network

------------------------------------------
Tiers
	Companines that own/operate the physical links are broken into Tiers
		[[Tier 1!http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tier_1_network]]
			The do not pay anyone for connections/traffic
			They offer "free peering" to each other (they'll carry other Tier 1's traffic for free)
			Oftentimes considered the backbone of the internet
		Tier 2 
			May peer with some other networks
			Pay for connections to other (Tier 1 or 2) networks
		Tier 3
			Pay for all their connections/traffic

------------------------------------------
Connecting
	There are numerous ways for customers to connect to the Internet
		Dialup
		ISDN
		DSL (ADSL)
		Cable
		Wireless (802.16)
		Satellite

-------------------------------------------
Dialup (POTS)
	Old, s l o w, internet access solution
	Utilizes a modem and analog signals over voice-grade lines
	Latest standards: V.90 & V.92
	Maximum download speed 56Kbps (33.6/48 up)
	Layer 2 protocols used with modems
		SLIP - Serial Line Internet Protocol (old)
		PPP - Point to Point protocol

------------------------------------------
ISDN
	Integrated Services Digital Network
	Uses digital signals over phone lines
	Utilizes a Terminal Adapter (TA) in place of a modem
	Two channel types
		B -carry data and voice (64Kbps)
		D - carry control signals (16Kbps)
	BRI - Two B, one D (128Kbps) 
	PRI - 23 B, one D (uses a T1)

-------------------------------------------
Digital Subscriber Line (DSL)
	Allows Phone companies to provide high-speed internet access
	Uses 1-pair Voice grade lines
	Data is sent at higher frequencies then voice
	Flavors: 
		ADSL - Downloads faster than upload
		SDSL - upload/download speeds are the same
	Requires 
		DSL Modem at customer's premises
		splitter at each customer phone jack
		DSL Access Multiplier (DSLAM) at central office
	1.5 - 3 Mbps download

-------------------------------------------
Cable
	Allows cable companies to provide high-speed internet access
	Trunk Lines run past homes
	Drop cables (RG-59) run to your house
	Requires Cable Modem in the home
	Bandwidth is shared on Trunk Lines
	1.5 - 6+ Mbps down

-------------------------------------------
Wireless
	Cellular 3G 
		Allows internet access via cell phone
		2-3 Mbps
	WiMax (802.16)
		Sold as "Clear" here in the Portland Area
		1-4 Mbps
	Satellite
		Utilizes small dish and expensive satellite
		Has small delay (~7/10 sec) known as satellite latency
		Typically uses phone lines for upstream

-------------------------------------------
Services
	Common Internet Services and their application layer protocols
		WWW (HTTP)
		email (SMTP & POP) 
		Newsgroups (NNTP)
		FTP (FTP)
		Voice over IP (VOIP)
	Terminal Emulation
		telnet (command line)
		Remote Desktop & Remote Assistance (GUI)
