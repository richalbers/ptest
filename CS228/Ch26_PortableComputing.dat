------------------------------------------
Notebook/Laptop Pros/Cons
	Pros
		Portable
	Cons
		Lower performance per dollar than Desktops
		Many Proprietary Parts
		More difficult and expensive to repair

------------------------------------------
Input Devices
	Keyboards
		Typically have a fn (function) key
		No separate number pad to right
	Pointing device
		Touchpad is most common
		Trackballs and trackpoints ([[pointing stick!http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pointing_stick]]) have been used in the past
		Touchscreens 
	External USB mice can easily be plugged in

------------------------------------------
Typical Ports
	Most have following ports
		Audio Port (headphones)
		Display port (for external monitor)
		Ethernet
		USB
	Less common
		firewire
		eSata
------------------------------------------
PC-Card slots
	Laptops don't have room for PCI or PCIe slots
	Instead, some used PC Card (PCMCIA) or ExpressCard slots (newer)
		All PC Card slots used an identical 68 pin connector
			Type I - Flash memory -	3.3mm thick, 16 bit bus
			Type II - Modems, NICs - 5.0 mm thick, 16/32 bit bus
			Type III -Hard Drives - 10.5 mm thick, 13/32 bit bus
			CardBus [[img http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fc/PCCard-ExpressCard_ZP.svg/500px-PCCard-ExpressCard_ZP.svg.png]]
				Effectivly a 32bit PCI bus in the CardBus form factor
				Backwards compatible with Type I-III 
		Express Card
			Physically incompatible with PC-Card & CardBus
			Built around PCI Express & USB 2.0 standards
			Two sizes
				ExpressCard 34
				ExpressCard 54
		These are now pretty much obsolete
------------------------------------------
Port Replicators / Docking Stations
	Port Replicators and Docking Stations are [[very similar devices!http://www.amazon.com/b?ie=UTF8&node=778660]]
	Port replicators
		Plugs into single port (USB or proprietary)
		Provides many other ports (serial, parallel, USB, network, etc..)
	Docking Station
		Attaches via proprietary connector
		Provides ports and possibly optical Drives
------------------------------------------
Battery Types
	NiCd - Nickel-Cadnium
		Least expensive
		Loses capacity if not discharged all the way
		Not common for PCs
	Ni-MH - Nickel-Metal Hydride
		Higher power density than NiCd
		Better performance than NiCd
	Lithium Ion (liIon)
		Most common - High power density
		Shorter Lifespan than Ni-MH
		Lose about 5% a year even if well cared for
		Heat kills them sooner
		Explode if overcharged (contain circuitry to prevent this)
	Lithium Polymer (LiPo)
		Moldable into different shapes
		Used in small electronics, tablets, some laptops
------------------------------------------
Power Management
	Power Management powers off select components in order to allow longer opration
	Versions
		APM - Advanced Power Managment
		ACPI - Advanced Configuration and Power Interface
	Configured via BIOS or Windows (Power Managment Console)
	ACPI Power States
		GO (S0) Working State
		G1 - Sleeping state
			S1 - CPU stops, Power to CPU and RAM is maintained
			S2 - CPU is powered down
			S3 - Sleep or standby mode - RAM is still powered
			S4 - Hibernation mode - memory is written to disk, everything's powered off
		G2 - Soft Power Mode - Devices to wake system are on, everything else's off
		G3 - OFF
------------------------------------------
Care
	Avoid Heat!!!!
		Don't place on soft surface (vents on bottom need air!)
		Use Power Managment
		Avoid keyboard protectors
	If fan runs a lot look into why
		Power settings?
		Dust in vents?
	Remove battery if storing for long time
	Be careful about power connector in foreign countries
------------------------------------------
Repairing
	Common Field Replacable Units
		RAM
			SO-DIMMs
		Hard Drives
			2.5"
			PATA or SATA
		Battery
	Other items can be replaced but may require significant teardown
		Keyboard, optical drive, LCD
