Ch 15 - Registry, Boot Process, Misc
	Registry
	System and Boot Partitions and Files
	XP Boot Process
		boot.ini file details
		ARC Naming Convention
	Vista/7 Boot process
	Task Manager
	Performance Monitor

------------------------------------------
Registry
	Database of System Information
		Device Drivers
		Services
		Installed Applications
		OS Components
		User Preferences
	Stored in files called hives
	Hives are located in \Windows\System32		

-------------------------------------------
Viewing & Editing Registry
	Manually viewed or edited using regedit/regedt32 
	Registry Editor displayes: [[img http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_SeWKZN00zoE/TIR6KAFLSAI/AAAAAAAAAzw/OKenQ5603Bc/s1600/RegistryIntroduction2.jpg]]
		keys & subkeys (appear as folders/subfolders)
		values & data
	Keys
		HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT
		HKEY_USERS 	
		HKEY_CURRENT_USER
		HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE
		HKEY_CURRENT_CONFIG 

------------------------------------------
System & Boot Partitions
	Crazy partition naming convention
		System Partition stores boot Files.
		Boot Partition stores the rest of the OS 
	XP Boot files:
		ntldr
		boot.ini (text file)
		ntdetect.com
		ntbootdd.sys (if using SCSI)
	Vista/7 Boot files
		BootMgr (Boot manager)
		Boot Configuration Data (BCD) file
		winload.exe (in Windows\System32)
-------------------------------------------
XP Boot Process
	BIOS finds boot disk
	MBR is loaded/run from boot disk
	Boot sector program is loaded/run from active partition
	NTLDR is loaded/run
	boot.ini is processed/displayed
	ntdetect is run
	OS is loaded & run

--------------------------------
XP Boot.ini file
	Contains boot info
	Located in root of system drive
	Boot Loader section
		timeout value
		Default OS location 
	Operating Systems section
		One entry for each OS to load
		NT systems specified by:
			ARC name (location)
			Text to dispay on screen
			Switches to pass to OS
		DOS/9x sections specfied by drive letter

---------------------------------
ARC Naming convention
	Used to specify location of OS to load
	Paramenters
		multi/scsi(0-x) - controller
		disk(0-x) - disk for SCSI
		rdisk(0-x) - disk for ATA
		partition(1-x) - Partition
	Example
		multi(0)disk(0)rdisk(0)parition(1)\windows

--------------------------------------------
Vista/7 Boot Process changes
	BootMGR replaces NTLDR
	BCD (boot configuration data) replaces boot.ini file
		Info is no long stored as text
		BCDEdit must be used to modify it
	Vista/7 support two firmware boot processes 
		BIOS (Basic I/O System) - old
		UEFI (Unified Extensible Firmware Interface) - new
----------------------------------------------
Vista/7 Boot Process
	BIOS based boot Process
		BIOS finds boot disk
		MBR is loaded/run from boot disk
		Boot sector program is loaded/run from active partition
		BootMGR is loaded/run
			BCD info is processed
		if Vista/7 version is selected
			BootMGR runs winload.exe
			Winload.exe loads Kernel (ntoskrnl.exe)
		if NT/NT/2K/XP system is selected
			ntldr is run... (see XP boot process)
	UEFI based boot process
		UEFI loads BootMGR directly
		The rest is the same as above
--------------------------------
Task Manager
	Provides an overview of the current state of the computer
	Lists apps, processes, performance overview, etc..
	Allows termination of apps or processes
	Run by:
		cntl-alt-delete
		Right-click on taskbar, select task manager
		From control panel
		and a few others...
--------------------------------
Performance Monitor
	Available on Admin Tools menu
	Visually displays performance data
		in realtime
		or from logs
	Hundreds of performance counters can be tracked, such as:
		CPU usage
		Disk I/O reads/writes
		Memory Page faults
