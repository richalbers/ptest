	User Accounts
	Authentication vs Authorization
	Passwords
	Groups
	Managing Users
	Login Options
	UAC
	Parental Controls
	NTFS
	Sharing
	Encryption
	UAC Details

--------------------------------
User Accounts
	Users Accounts are the foundation up which security is built
	User Accounts:
		are given permissions to files
		are given rights to do things
	User Account types
		Local - Managed by clients (i.e. XP/Vista/7)	
		Domain - Managed by domain controller
	Default accounts
		Administrator
		Guest

--------------------------------
Authentication vs Authorization
	Authentication - determining the user is who they say they are
		Username
		Password
	Authorization - What a user can access and do
		NTFS permissions
		User Rights

--------------------------------------
Passwords
	Passwords are the key to protecting your computer
		Good passwords are essential
		Never give your password to anyone, even the admin
		Password is case sensitive
		Users should create their own
	Admins cannot see or retrieve user passwords, but can reset them
			If reset, the user will no longer be able to access previously encrypted files
	Many places force users to change passwords periodically
	User can create "forgotten password disk"
		Keep in safe place, use when password is forgotten
		Windows 7 also lets you set a password hint

--------------------------------
Groups
	Groups make administration easier
	User Accounts should be put into groups
	Groups are given rights and permissions
	Default XP groups
		Administrators
		Power Users (pro)
		Users (Limited Users)
		Everyone
		Guests
	Vista/7 Pro groups
		Those plus more....
--------------------------
Managing Users
	There are two tools available for managing users
		User Applet on Control Panel
			Simple, appears designed for home use
		Local Users and Groups tool (from computer managment console)
			More complex with more features/controls
-----------------------------
Login Options
	Welcome Screen (introduced with XP)
		Default
		List of users is displayed
		Administrator is not displayed (by default)
		Supports fast user switching
	Logon Window
		Most Secure
		Press cntrl-alt-delete
		Enter username and password
	Selected via User Applet on Control panel
--------------------------------
User Account Control
	Historically, Windows users needed to be admins to install software
	This allowed them to easily accidently install malware
	UAC solves this
		When admin rights are to be used, system prompts for admin credentials
		Introduced (poorly) with Vista
		Made usable in 7
--------------------------------------------
Parental Controls
	Vista/7 have parental controls
	These allow you to monitor and limit activities of any standard user
		Block websites type or URL, or only allow certain websites
		Limit times and length of login
		Block games with certain ESRB ratings

--------------------------------------------
NTFS
	A secure, robust file system introduced with Windows NT
	NTFS features:
		Redundancy
			Has backup copy of MFT
		Recoverability
			Uses transaction logging
		Security
			Each file is owned by a specific user
			User access to files and folders is configurable via permissions

------------------------------------------
File Ownership
	Each file is owned by the person that created it
	The owner can do whatever he wants with a file, including changing permissions
	There is a take ownership permission that, when given to someone, allows them to take ownership of the file
	Administrators have take ownership permission
	By default Files inherit the permissions from the folder they're in

------------------------------------------
Basic NTFS Permissions
	Full Control
	Modify
	Read & Execute
	List Folder Contents (folders only)
	Read
	Write

----------------------------------------
Moving and Copying files
	Rule 1 - New files always inherit their permissions from the folder into which they're placed.
	Copying a file creates a new file, see Rule 1
	Moving a file to a new volume creates a new file (and deletes the original), see Rule 1
	Moving files within the same volume doesn't create a new file, and doesn't change permissions
	Permissions only apply on NTFS volumes (not FAT)

----------------------------------------
Sharing
	Sharing can mean two things
		Local Sharing - Making a folder available to other users on the local machine
			Actually just done with NTFS permissions
			Public folders are done this way
		Network Sharing - Making a folder available on the network
			Involves both NTFS and Sharing permissions
	Local sharing his handled with NTFS permissions
		Public folders are configured to allow sharing with everyone

------------------------------------------
Simple File Sharing
	NTFS is complicated, so with XP, Microsoft created Simple File Sharing for home/small office use
	Simple File Sharing, when enabled, hides all the NTFS permissions
	Public Folder has permissions set so all users can write to it
	It's enabled via Windows Explorer
		Tools->Folder Options, View Tab, last checkbox.
	Note: it is disabled if the computer is a part of a domain

--------------------------------------------
Sharing in Vista/Windows 7
	With Vista/7 there's a new simple User Interface for sharing files/folders with specific users
		Right-click on a folder/file and select "Share With" from the context menu
		Select the user you want to share the file with
		Choose the following "share" level
			reader - user can read the file
			contributor (folder) - read and write
			co-owner - full control
	Note: this simple interface utilizes NTFS permissions behind the scenes to actually implement the funtionality

--------------------------------------------
Encryption
	Encrypted File System (EFS)
		Allows encrypting folder contents
		User encrypting data and Admin can get access
	Bitlocker
		Allows encrypting entire hard drive
		Supported by Vista/7
		Requires hardware support (TPM)
		Control Panel -> System and Security -> Bitlocker
--------------------------------------------
UAC Details (7)
	UAC level can be set via Control Panel applet (User Accounts)
		Always notify me 
		Notify me when programs make changes (but not when I do)
		Same as above but in normal dialog box
		Never Notify me (UAC is off)
