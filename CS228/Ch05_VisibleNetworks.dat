	NIC (Network Interface Card)
	Frames/Packets
	Protocols

------------------------------------------
Topology
	Types
		Bus
		Ring
		Star
		Mesh
	Modern Wired Ethernet LANs use Unshielded Twisted Pair (UTP) wired in a physical star topology
	Signalling (logical) Method is bus

------------------------------------------
Early Networks
	Early LANs were built using one of two competing technologies
		Token Ring 
		Ethernet
	Ethernet became the dominate technology, and is now ubiquitous
	Early etherenet used coax in a bus topology

------------------------------------------
Modern Wired Ethernet
	Ethernet Standards
		10BaseT
		100BaseT
		1000BaseT
	UTP Categories
		CAT 3 - 16Mbps
		CAT 5 - 100Mbps
		CAT 5e - 1000Mbps (1Gbps)
		CAT 6 - 10Gbps

-------------------------------------------
NICs
	Modern cards are full duplex
	Cables connect via RJ45 jacks/connectors
	RJ-45 Wiring standards
		TIA/EIA 568A
		TIA/EIA 568B
	Status lights
		Link 
		Activity
-----------------------------------------------
LANs and WANs
	LAN - Local Area Network
		A group of networking devices that are physically close
		All can reach each other directly (i.e. if one broadcasts, they all hear it)
		Typically one IP subnet
	WAN - Wide Area Network
		A geographically dispersed collection of LANs
		Spans a large area
		LANs are connected to a WAN using a router
			Router has both a LAN address and WAN address
-------------------------------------------------
TCP/IP
	Network/Transport layer protocol used on the Internet
	Key Properties
		IP address
		Subnet Mask
		Gateway
		DNS Server
-----------------------------------------------
Network Organization
	Workgroup
		Group of computers sharing a common "workgroup" name
		Each manages it's own security (each has it's own list of users)
	Domain
		Group of computers that share a central security database
		Database is called Active Directory on Windows
		Requires use of Windows Server to manage the database
	HomeGroup
		Group of computers that can more easily share files
		Single password is used to allow all computers access to data
		Simpler to manage security in than workgroups
		Available in Windows 7
