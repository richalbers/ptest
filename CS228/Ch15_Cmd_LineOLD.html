Ch 15 - Windows Command Line
	Why a command line?
	Windows Command Shells
	Filename Rules
	Command Syntax
	Help Text
	Fundamental Commands
	Wildcards
	Batch Files
	Path
	Additonal Commands

------------------------------------------
Why a command line?
	It's faster for many operations
	Scripts (batch files) can be written that automate tasks
	Sometimes necessary for troubleshooting when you can't get to a GUI
		recovery console provides only a command line
		Many 3rd party boot disks provide only a command line

--------------------------------------------
Windows Command Shells
	command.com is the old 16-bit DOS cmd line. 
		Don't ever use this.  It's for backwards compatibility with old programs.
	cmd.exe is the 32-bit Windows command line.
		Supports long filenames
		Supports history
	cmd.exe is in accessories, or can be run from run menu (start->run, type cmd, press enter)

------------------------------------------
Filename rules
	Filenames are typically  composed of letters, numbers, and spaces, but may contain many other characters.
	Disallowed characters
		[code]
		* " / \ [ ] : ; ! =
	These charactes have special meaning to the shell
	
------------------------------------------
Command Syntax
	Basic Syntax
		[code]
		command /switch argument
	switches affect the way the command behaves
	argument(s) are what the command operates on (typcially a file or folder name)
	Examples
		[code]
		dir
		dir /A
		dir /A afolder
------------------------------------------
Help text
	Each command provides terse help text describing all the command's switches and arguments
	Type the command name followed by /? to see help text
		Optional switches/arguments are shown in [ ]
		Those not in [ ] are mandatory
		Mutually excluse switches are separated with |
		If a switch has an argument it's separated by a :
	Look at the help text of the following
		dir
		copy

------------------------------------------
Fundamental Commands
	dir - directory listing
	cd - change directory	
		note: doesn't change drives (use d: for that)
	md - make directory
	rd - remove directory
	ren - rename a file
	del - delete a file
	copy - copy a file
	xcopy - copies directory trees
	attrib - changing file attributes
-------------------------------------------
Wildcards
	Wildcards can be used in file and folder names
		* - matches multple characters
		? - matches a single character
	Examples
		dir *.txt
		dir xyz.*
		copy * somefolder
 
-------------------------------------------
Batch Files
	Batch files allow you to run a sequence of commands
	Batch files 
		end in .bat
		Should contain only cmd line commands
		comment lines begin with a # or rem
	echo is a common batch file command. 
		It can be used to print text to the screen
			[code]
			echo "Hello"
		And it can be used to control if the commands being executed are displayed
			[code]
			echo off
			echo on
-------------------------------------------
path
	path contains a ; delimited list of directories that specify where the system will look for commands
	Commands are files that end in .exe, .com. or .bat (and others)
	When a command is typed, the system looks in the current directory, then those specfied by the path from left to right
	If the command is not found in any of those locations, you'll get an error message.
	To see your path, type
		[code]
		path
	To change your path,type
		[code]
		path="c:\windows;c:\windows\system32"
-------------------------------------------
Additional Commands
	chkdsk - checks disk/volume for errors
	format - puts file system on partition/volume
	sfc - checks/restores system files
	compact - compresses files/folders
	cipher - encrypts files/folders
	
-------------------------------------------
Closing Remarks   
	The command line is NOT DOS
		DOS is an OS
		The command line is a user interface
	The command line should never be referred to as DOS
	The command line should never be referred to as DOS
	The command line should never be referred to as DOS
