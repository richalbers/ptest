--------------------------------------------
Installation Preparation
	Identfify Hardware Requirements
	Verify Hardware and Software Compatibilty
	Decide on Clean Install or Upgrade
	Determine Data Backup/Restore process
	Select an installation method
	Determine Partition Scheme (for clean installs)
	Determine Network settings (for clean installs)
	Plan for post-installation tasks 

------------------------------------------------
Verify Hardware and Software Compatibilty
	Since Win95, Microsoft has produced a list of "compatible" hardware/software
		Up to XP - Hardware Compatibilty list
		XP - HCL or Windows Catalog
		Vista - Windows Logo'd Products list
		Win 7 - Compatibilty Center (website)
	Upgrade Advisor will analyze system to see if it will run 7
		Located on Win 7 CD and/or downloadable
	Just because MS doesn't think a piece of hardware is compatible, it still may be
		Check Hardware manufacturers site for latest drivers.

----------------------------------------------
Installation Types
	NT/2K/XP/Vista/7 installs are all very similar
	Install types
		Clean
			Wipes out all existing config info and software
		Upgrade
			Existing info & software carries forward
			In theory faster, in practice, often not
			Not all upgrade paths are valid
	Multiboot install - clean on separate partition
		With XP, you could specify the folder (and therefore install two OSs on the same partition)
	Activation - required by XP/Vista/7

--------------------------------------------
Installation Methods
	Attended
		You sit there and answer all the prompts
	Unattended
		You create an answer-file that is then used during the install
		In theory, you can simply start the install, and come back later to an up-and-running system
		On XP, Setup Manager is used to create the answer file
		On Vista/7, a new process: WAIK (windows automated Install Kit) is used
	Installs can be done off media or over the network from a shared folder
--------------------------------------------
Install Methods Continued...
	Image Deployment (cloning)
		Most common for large deployments
		Allows cloning OS and all Applications
		Sysprep is used to prepare disk for cloning
		Ghost is commonly used for the cloning.  WAIK (Vista/7) includes imageing tools.
		
--------------------------------------------
Post-Install Tasks
	Apply latest Windows Updates
	Upgrade drivers
	Restore User Data (if applicable)

-------------------------------------------------------
Migrating
	Migrating is moving from an old computer to a new computer
		Files, User accounts & settings, application settings, etc.. 
	Migration Tools
		Small number of users
			File and Settings Transfer Wizard (to XP)
			Windows Easy Transfer (to Win 7)
		Large Number of users (Domains)
			User State Migration Tool
