Patches / Updates
	Code (including Windows) has bugs
		bugs may cause computer to crash unexpectedly
		bugs may allow malicious people to use your computer for nefarious purposes
	Microsoft fixes the bugs and releases the new code as a patch
	People neglect to install patches so problems persist....
	So, Microsoft created an automatic update process to eliminate as much user interaction as possible
	Configuration is done at:
		XP
			Control Panel | Security Center | Automatic Updates
		7 (new locations, more options)
			Start | All Programs | Windows Update
			Control Panel | Windows Update
