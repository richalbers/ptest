<div id="Course" class="Content">
<h2> Course Info</h2>

<p><b>Course Description:</b>  This class is a continuation of the hands-on training in servicing PCs began in CS227.  It includes working with and troubleshooting system hardware and software, with a strong focus on the topics emphasized by the CompTIA A+ certification exams.</p>

<p><b>Course Objectives:</b> Upon completion of this course, each student should be able to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Install and upgrade Windows</li>
<li>Understand and troubleshoot the boot process</li>
<li>Configure the Windows UI</li>
<li>Use various Windows System utilities</li>
<li>Use the Windows command line</li>
<li>Understand, configure, and troubleshoot printers</li>
<li>Explain the features and differences of mobile devices (iOS and Android)</li>
<li>Configure and use Windows networking utilities</li>
<li>Troubleshoot both hardware and software problems.</li>
</ol>

<p><b>Prerequisites:</b> Completion of CS-227 (or instructor approval)</p>

<p>The class is offered in a lab environment and is a combination of theory and practice. The student will use the textbook, web research, and interaction with the instructor and fellow students to gain insight into the topics covered. Because of the collaborative nature of the class, and the fact that material will be presented that is not available in the textbooks, regularly attending class is essential.</p>
</div>


<!-- =========== Instructor ============ -->
<div id="Instructor" class="Content">
<h2> Instructor Info</h2>
<p><b>Name: &nbsp;</b>Richard Albers<br />
<b>Email:&nbsp;</b> richa@clackamas.edu<br />
<b>Office:</b> Streeter - S126<br />
<b>Hours:</b>M,W,F 10:00-11:00, Tu,Th 9:00-10:00 or by appointment<br />
<b>Phone:</b> 503-594-3166  (email is preferred)</p>

<p>Before becoming a full time instructor, I worked in the computer industry for numerous years, primarily as a software engineer.  At several of the small companies at which I worked, the software engineers were also responsible for the computer and network management and troubleshooting.  As a result, I've gained a wide range of experience with various computer and networking systems. I've now been teaching computer classes for 10+ years, am CompTIA A+ and Network+ certified, and have a Master's degree in Computer Systems Engineering.</p></div>

<!-- =========== Materials ============ -->
<div id="Materials" class="Content">
<h2> Materials</h2>
<p><b>Textbook:</b> Mike Meyers' CompTIA A+ Guide to Managing and Troubleshooting PCs (Fourth Edition) <br />
by Mike Meyer &nbsp; ISBN: 978-0-07-179591-3</p>

<p>This is the same book which was used for CS227 (PC Hardware and Repair I) last term.</p>

<p><b>Website:</b> We will be using Moodle for announcements, distribution of class materials, quizzes, and exams. </p>

<p><b>Optional Tools:</b> Technician toolkit (screwdriver, etc.) and anti-static kit (wrist strap, lead, alligator clip).  Additional information will be provided in class.
</p>
</div>

<!-- =========== Grading ============ -->
<div id="Grading" class="Content">
<h2> Grading</h2>

<p>This course will use proficiency-based grading, an approach that emphasises a student's ability to demonstrate mastery of the content instead of simply earning points throughout the course.</p>

<p>After a topic is covered, you'll be given the opportunity to take a low-value assessment (review quiz) as many times as necessary until you're confident you know the material well.  You'll then take an slighly-higher value assessment in class (quiz) to demonstrate your proficiency on the topic.  Two exams, a midterm and final, will be used to assess your overall level of understanding at the midpoint and end of the course.  All the questions on the midterm and final will be pulled from the review quizzes and labs so there will be no surprises. </p>

<p>The graded work will be weighted as follows:</p>

<table zalign="center">
<tr><td colspan=2>Learning Exercises</td> <td></td> <td></td> </tr>	
<tr><td> &nbsp;  &nbsp;</td><td>Labs:			</td><td> &nbsp; </td><td>30%</td></tr>
<tr><td> &nbsp;  &nbsp;</td><td>Assignments:	</td><td> &nbsp; </td><td>5%</td></tr>
<tr><td> &nbsp;  &nbsp;</td><td>Review Quizzes:	</td><td> &nbsp; </td><td>5%</td></tr>
<tr><td> &nbsp;  &nbsp;</td><td>Presentation:	</td><td> &nbsp; </td><td>5%</td></tr>
<tr><td colspan=2>Assessments</td> <td></td> <td></td> </tr>
<tr><td> &nbsp; &nbsp;</td><td>Quizzes:	</td><td> &nbsp; </td><td>10%</td></tr>
<tr><td> &nbsp; &nbsp;</td><td>Midterm:	</td><td> &nbsp; </td><td>15%</td></tr>	
<tr><td> &nbsp; &nbsp;</td><td>Final:	</td><td> &nbsp; </td><td>30%</td></tr>	
</table>


<p><b>Labs:</b> Numerous lab exercises will be done during the course while the class is in session.  You can seek assistance from other class members or the instructor when working on the lab if problems are encountered.  If you miss a class, there may not be time to make it up later in the term.</p>

<p><b>Assignments:</b>There will be two assignments given during the course, which are practice A+ exams that you take at home.  You may re-take these as often as you like, turning in your best results by the specified due date (near the end of the course).</p>

<p><b>Review Quizzes:</b> There will be weekly on-line review quizzes over the topics covered that week available on the class website. These quizzes are meant as learning exercises and may be taken as many times as you'd like (it's recommended you take each numerous times, ideally, until you get a 10 several times in a row).  In most cases, each time you take a review quiz, you'll get a random selection of questions over that weeks content. The highest grade you receive on the quiz will be the grade recorded for that quiz. (e.g. if you take a quiz 3 times, and score an 8, 10, and 6, the 10 is recorded). </p>

<p><b>Presentation:</b> A short presentation on a pre-approved course-related topic of your choice will be given near then end of the term.  Each person must do a presentation and provide constructive feedback for all other presentations.  The goal of the presentation is to give you some practice explaining technical information to others in a clear manner, and learning (and explaining) more details about a particular course-related topic.</p>

<p><b>Quizzes:</b> There will be a weekly quiz over the topics covered the previous week which will assess how well you learned that content.  These quizzes will be given in class and consist of questions either exactly like, or very similar to, the questions available on the review quizzes or at the back of the chapter. If you must miss class, you need to notify the instructor in advance (preferably via email) in order to be allowed to make up a quiz which was taken in class, and make-up quizzes will need to be taken outside of class before the following week's class.</p>

     
<p><b>Exam:</b> 2 exams will be given, a midterm and a final.  Exam questions will come from the review quizzes, questions at the end of the chapters, and lab work.</p>

<p>Grading scale: 90%-100% = A, 80%-89.9% = B, 70%-79.9% = C, 60%-69.9% = D, &lt; 60% = F</p>
</div>

<!-- =========== Misc ============ -->
<div id="Misc" class="Content">
<h2> Misc</h2>
<p><b>Attendance:</b> Regular attendance is essential to your success in this course. Students are responsible for everything that takes place during class, whether covered in written materials or not.  Additionally, some of each class day will be devoted to hand-on activities, and if a class must be missed, there will not be time to make up those activities in the future.</p>

<p><b>Professionalism:</b> All participants in the class will are required to conduct themselves in a courteous, professional manner at all times. This includes communications in person, via phone, via e-mail or through an online chat or discussion.</p>

<p><b>Ethics: </b>Plagiarism or cheating of any variety will be dealt with in accordance with the policies expressed in the student handbook. Possible consequences for academic dishonesty are: receiving no credit for the assignment in question, failing the course, and/or appearing before the college disciplinary board.</p>

<p><b>Food / Drink Policy:</b> Eating is not allowed while class is in session.  Drinking beverages is acceptable provided the beverage is in a sealable container and you aren't interfering with the learning environment of the class.</p>

<p><b>Cell Phones:</b> Cell phones should not interfere with the learning environment of the class.  Each time your cell phone rings during class, &frac12; % will be deducted from your grade.  That's &frac12; % per ring, not per call, and if you phone plays music instead of ringing, every 3 seconds of music will be considered one ring.  If you believe you must have your phone on during class, please discuss this with the instructor before class begins to see if an exception will be allowed.  If the instructor's phone rings, everyone gets &frac12; %.</p>

<p><b>Special Needs:</b> If you are a student with a disability and you believe that your opportunities to be successful in this class are affected by that disability, please contact the Clackamas CC Disability Resource Center.  Their website is <a href="http://www.clackamas.edu/DisabilityResourceCenter/" target="_blank">http://www.clackamas.edu/DisabilityResourceCenter/</a>.</p>

<p><b>Incomplete Grades:</b>  An incomplete grade can be given at the discretion of the instructor if you have satisfactorily (C or better) completed at least 75% of the class work. Arrangements must be made with the instructor before finals week in order to be considered for an incomplete.</p>


<p><b>Emergency Procedures:</b>  When a fire alarm sounds, all students are expected to exit the building immediately.  The security of items left behind is not guaranteed, however, so students should gather all personal belongings before proceeding to the nearest exit.</p>
