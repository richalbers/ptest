Printer Types
	Impact (Dot Matrix)
	Inkjet
	Dye-Sublimation
	Solid Ink
	Thermal
	Laser
------------------------------------------
Impact
	Create an image on paper by physcially strikin gan ink ribbon against the paper's surface [[img http://images.highspeedbackbone.net/skuimages/large/E17-3470-main2.jpg]]
	Last type standing: Dot matrix
	Didn't these things die in the 90s?
		No!  Because they can do multipart forms!
	Parts [[img http://indocashregister.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/04/images_diagrams_diagram1.gif]]
		Printhead
		Printwires
	Types
		9-pin - draft quality
		24-pin Near Letter Quality
	Typicallly use tractor feed paper
------------------------------------------
Inkjet
	Sprays tiny dots of ink on paper [[img http://www.techfresh.net/wp-content/uploads/2006/10/dell_photo-all-in-one-926-inkjet-printer.jpg]]
	Prints in color
		Ink is stored in cartriges contained in the printhead, which moves back and forth across the page
		Colors (CMYK)
			Cyan, Magneta, Yellow, Black
	Print quality features
		Print Resolution - density of ink (dpi)
		Print speed (pages per minute)
	Cheap to buy, expensive to operate
------------------------------------------
Dye Sublimation
	Uses heat to change solid ink to vapor and place on paper [[img http://www.togblog.biz/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/DyeSubDiagram-copy1-copy.jpg]]
	Uses roll of heat sensitive plastic film embeded with page sized sections of each color
	Prints very high-quality color documents or photos
	Requires one pass for each color
	Generally, slow and expensive to operate
------------------------------------------
Solid Ink
	Prints color
	Utilizes solid sticks of ink
	Prints in one pass
	Very expensive
------------------------------------------
Thermal Printer
	Direct thermal printer [[img http://www.slxntech.com/images/products/printers/srp350g.gif]]
		Uses heating element to burn dots on heat-sensitive paper
		Commonly used to print receipts
	Thermal Wax printer
		Similar to Dye-sublimination but use film covered with colored wax
------------------------------------------
Laser Printer
	Uses electro-photographic imaging [[img http://www.computershopper.com/var/ezwebin_site/storage/images/media/images/how-it-works-laser-printer/220996-1-eng-US/how-it-works-laser-printer.jpg]]
		Toner (fine powder) is positioned and melted onto paper
	Both Black and Color versions available
	Somewhat expensive to purchase, but inexpensive to operate
	Most common type of printer for general printing in business
------------------------------------------
Laser Printer Parts
	Toner Cartridge [[img http://www.certiguide.com/aplush/diagrams/figure86.png]]
		Toner
		Photosensitive drum
		Primary corona 
		Other high wear parts 
	Erase Lamp
	Laser
	Transfer corona
	Fuser
------------------------------------------
Laser Process
	1. Drum is Cleaned [[img http://bucarotechelp.com/computers/anatomy/images/laser.jpg]]
		Particles and charge are removed 
	2. Charge Applied to drum (Condition)
		-600 volt charge is applied to drum via primary corona wire
	3. Write Image to drum
		Laser removes negative charge on drum where image goes
	4. Develop
		Negatively charged toner sticks to drum where charge was removed
	5. Transfer
		Toner particles are transferred to the paper (which is postively charged)
	6. Fuse
		Toner is burned onto paper via fuser
------------------------------------------
Laser Printer Maintenance
	Toner and paper dust build up over time 
	Clean printer each time toner cartridge is changed
		Use compressed air to blow toner particles out (outside) or low-static vacuum
		User alcohol and towel to clean rollers and possibly primary Corona wire
		Ozone filter may need to be cleaned or replaced (to keep it trapping ozone!)
		If instructions were provided with printer, follow them	
	Memory can often be upgraded 
	Danger Will Robinson!
		Laser printer contains high-voltage transformer!  Never open it up without turning it off!!!	
------------------------------------------
Printer Languages
	Printer languages allow the printer to do most of the work involved in creating a printed document
		ASCII
			Text (and a few symbols)
		PCL
			Primarily Text
			Scalable fonts and line drawing
		PostScript 
			Graphics and text (scalable)
			Fast (hardware support in printer)
-------------------------------------------
Windows Printing Systems
	GDI 
		Windows Graphics Device Interface
		Work is done on computer, bitmapped image sent to printer
	XPS
		XML Paper Specification
		Improvements to Windows GDI process
-------------------------------------------
Printer Connectivity
	Parallel (IEEE1284)
		Port Types (configurable in BIOS)
			SPP - Standard Parallel Port
			EPP - Enhanced Parallel Port (bidirectional)
			ECP - Extended Capabilities Port (bidirectional, faster)
		Uses DB25 and Centronics connector
	USB
	Network
	Firewire (rare)
-------------------------------------------
Terminology
	The terms "printer" and "network printer" don't mean the same thing to all people
	CompTIA (A+) 
		Printer is hardware (and software)
		Network printer is a printer with a NIC attached directly to the network
	Microsoft 
		Printer is software (usually)
		Printing Device is hardware (usually)
		Local Printer is software installed locally to manage print jobs
		Network Printer is a redirector that sends print jobs to another computers local printer
------------------------------------------
Troubleshooting
	The most common laser printer problem is dirty printouts, which is caused by the printer never being cleaned
	If toner "falls off" page, fuser has died
	Many other (less common) problems are discussed in the book.
	Oftentimes the cost of repairing an old printer is greater the replacment cost
