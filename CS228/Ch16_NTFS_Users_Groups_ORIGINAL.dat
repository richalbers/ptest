Ch 16 - NTFS, Users, and Groups
	User Accounts
	Authentication vs Authorization
	Login Options
	User Account Control
	Password Details
	Groups
	NTFS
	Sharing
	Encryption

--------------------------------
User Accounts
	Users Accounts are the foundation up which security is built
	User Accounts:
		are given permissions to files
		are given rights to do things
	User Account types
		Local - Managed by clients (i.e. XP)	
		Domain - Managed by domain controller
	Default accounts
		Administrator
		Guest

--------------------------------
Authentication vs Authorization
	Authentication - determining the user is who they say they are
		Username
		Password
	Authorization - What a user can access and do
		NTFS permissions
		User Rights
		


--------------------------------
Login Options
	Welcome Screen (introduced with XP)
		Default
		List of users is displayed
		Administrator is not displayed (by default)
		Supports fast user switching
	Logon Window
		Most Secure
		Press cntrl-alt-delete
		Enter username and password
	Automatic Login
		Can be configured via registry modifications
		Useful for publicly accessible computers
		Unsecure, therefore to be used with caution and care

--------------------------------
User Account Control
	Historically, Windows users needed to be admins to install software
	This allowed them to easily accidently install malware
	UAC solves this
		Users don't need to be admins
		When admin rights are needed, system prompts for admin credentials
		Introduced (poorly) with Vista
		Made usable in 7

--------------------------------
Password Details
	Password is case sensitive
	Users should create their own
	Admin cannot see or retrieve user passwords
	Admin CAN reset a password
		User will no longer be able to access previously encrypted files
	User can create "forgotten password disk"
		Keep in safe place
		Use when password is forgotten
		
--------------------------------
Groups
	Groups make administration easier
	User Accounts should be put into groups
	Groups are given rights and permissions
	Default groups
		Administrators
		Power Users
		Users (Limited Users)
		Guests
		Backup Operators

--------------------------------------------
NTFS
	A secure, robust file system introduced with Windows NT
	NTFS features:
		Redundancy
			Has backup copy of MFT
		Recoverability
			Uses transaction logging
		Security
			Each file is owned by a specific user
			User access to files and folders is configurable via permissions

------------------------------------------
File Ownership
	Each file is owned by the person that created it
	The owner can do whatever he wants with a file, including changing permissions
	There is a take ownership permission that, when given to someone, allows them to take ownership of the file
	Administrators have take ownership permission
	By default Files inherit the permissions from the folder they're in

------------------------------------------
Basic NTFS Permissions
	Full Control
	Modify
	Read & Execute
	List Folder Contents (folders only)
	Read
	Write

----------------------------------------
Moving and Copying files
	Rule 1 - New files always inherit their permissions from the folder into which they're placed.
	Copying a file creates a new file, see Rule 1
	Moving a file to a new volume creates a new file (and deletes the original), see Rule 1
	Moving files within the same volume doesn't create a new file, and doesn't change permissions
	Permissions only apply on NTFS volumes (not FAT)

----------------------------------------
Sharing
	Local Sharing - Making a folder available to other users on the local machine
		Actually just done with NTFS permissions
		Public folders are done this way
	Network Sharing - Making a folder available on the network
		Folder is given a "share" name
		Accessed using UNC path name
			\\Server\share
		Involves share permissions as well as NTFS permissions
		Every folder has a share tab
		Shared Folders tool in Computer Managment shows network shares
		Hidden shares share names end in a $

------------------------------------------
Simple File Sharing
	NTFS is complicated, so with XP, Microsoft created Simple File Sharing for home/small office use
	Simple File Sharing, when enabled, hides all the NTFS permissions
	Public Folder has permissions set so all users can write to it
	It's enabled via Windows Explorer
		Tools->Folder Options, View Tab, last checkbox.
	Note: it is disabled if the computer is a part of a domain

--------------------------------------------
Encryption
	Encrypted File System (EFS)
		Allows encrypting folder contents
		User encrypting data and Admin can get access
	Bitlocker
		Allows encrypting entire hard drive
		Supported by Vista/7
		Requires hardware support (TPM)
		Control Panel -> System and Security -> Bitlocker
