------------------------------------------
Hardware Boot Issues
	Nothing on screen?
		Hardware issues
			check simple things first (connections/switches/etc.)
			Then try replacing components
	"No boot device detected" message
		Booting off wrong disk?  
			Check if CD/thumb drive's present
			Check CMOS boot drive order

-------------------------------------------
XP Pre-GUI Boot Issues
	Boot Errors
		"NTLDR Bad or Missing" [[img http://bcrawfordjr.files.wordpress.com/2009/03/r.png]]
		or "Invalid Boot.ini"
	Solutions
		Boot to recovery console off XP Media (provides a command line interface)
		Run following commands [[img http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-QvnlbRV1gqA/T0iIegOHUNI/AAAAAAAAAOA/_E0zgXjwv-E/s1600/rc_login.jpg]]
			fixmbr	(fixes MBR)
			fixboot (fixes boot sector)
			copy d:\i386\ntldr c:\
			copy d:\i386\ntdetect.com c:\
			bootcfg /rebuild  (fixes boot.ini)
		If that all fails, use ASR (hah!)
		Start reinstall, choose repair option
--------------------------------------------
Vista/7 Pre-GUI boot Issues
	bootmgr and BCD are the critical boot files that may get corrupt
	WinRE (Recovery Environment) allows you to fix boot issues [[img http://www.leinss.com/images/winre3.jpg]]
		It replaces XP's Recovery Console
		It includes several utilities to diagnose and fix boot issues
	WinRE runs within WinPE (preinstallation environment)
---------------------------------------------
WinRE continued...
	WinRE can be loaded 
		From the "Advanced Boot Options Menu"  [[img images/Win7_ABO.jpg]]
			if you have boot isssues, you might not get to that screen
		By booting off the Win 7 DVD and choosing repair (preferred)
		From a previously created system repair disk
			Control Panel | System and Security | Backp and Restore | Create Repair Disk
------------------------------------------
WinRE - Startup Repair
	Repairs Registry (using backup copy stored on disk)
	Restores critical system and driver files
	Runs equivalent of XP's fixboot and fixmbr
	Rolls back non-working drivers
	Uninstallls any incompatible service packs and patches
	Runs chkdsk
	Runs memory test
------------------------------------------
WinRE - other options
	System Restore
		Restores from restore point
	System Image Recovery
		Allows you to restore from a previously created system image (backup created using Backup Tool)
	Windows Memory Diagnostics
		Runs memory diagnositic tool
	Command Prompt (GUI's are for the weak!)
		Useful Commands
			bootrec [/fixboot | /fixmbr | /scanos | /rebuildmbr]
			reg
------------------------------------------
Working with BCD
	Boot Configuration Data consists of boot configuration parameters and how the operating system is started 
	In XP, this was stored in boot.ini
		text file
		editable with notepad
	In Vista/7 it's stored in BCD file 
		binary file
		Edited with bcdEdit
			Not user friendly, 3rd party tool, EasyBCD, is easier
--------------------------------------------
Advanced Startup Options
	If windows hangs when startup image is displayed (GUI can't be loaded), you need to use advanced startup options [[img http://www.maximumpc.com/files/u21826/W7-RE02.jpg]]
	Boot system, press F8 after POST 

--------------------------------------------
Fixing Registry
	A corrupt registry could keep system from booting
	XP has a backup copy of the original registry in \windows\repair
		You could Boot to the recovery console and copy these over corrupt registry files, but since they're old and out of date it's pointless....
	Vista/7 has a recent backup of the registry in \windows\system32\config\RegBack
		Boot to WinRE, run reg command, then copy the backup files over the current versions

--------------------------------------------
Troubleshooting tools in GUI
	Task Manager (cntrl-alt-del)
		Lets you kill run-away processes
	Services (on admin tools menu)
		Lets you configure service startup and error recovery
	Event Viewer (on Admin Tools menu)
		Three error logs
			Application, Security, System
		Errors include links to Microsoft.com help
		New interface in Vista/7
	System Restore (discussed previously)
--------------------------------------------
New 7 tools
	Action Center (control panel)
		Displayes significant event messages
			Security
			Maintenance
	Performance Info and Tools (control panel)
		Rates system performance - shows weak link
--------------------------------------------
Application Problems
	Installing or Uninstalling apps takes admin privilages
	Some apps depend on certain OS subsystems such as .NET to be installed and up-to-date
	Some apps are written for prevous versions of Windows and need to be run in compatibilty mode
		Right-click on app, go to compatibilty tab
	Many apps are dependent on specific versions of DLLs
		Use google to find solution/DLL
