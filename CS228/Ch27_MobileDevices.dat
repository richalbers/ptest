	User Interface
	Applications
	Expandability
	Networking
	Synchronization
	Security

------------------------------------------
Overview
	Categories
		Smartphones
		Tablets
	Operating Systems
		iOS (all apple products)
		Android (almost all non-apple products)
		Windows RT ("Windows" tablets)
	Single/Multi user
		iOS devices are "single user"
		Latest Android devices (and Windows RT) are "muli user"
			Apps are tied to user account, not shared
----------------------------------------------
Screen Technology
	LCD screen
		with a capactive touchscreen over it
			Uses electrical charge on your body to determine touch location
			Won't work with stylus or gloved hand
			Current technology
		with resistive touchscreens 
			Responded to pressure; stylus was required
			Older, less common technology
------------------------------------------
User Interface
	Touch interface - recognizes a single touch
		tap (or doubletap)
		swipe
	Multitouch interface - recognizes two or more simultaneous touches
		pinch or zoom
	Accelerometers allow screen to always be displayed upright regardless of orientation of device
	Gyroscopes allow additional detection of device position (leaning forward or backward)
	On-screen keyboards are displayed when required
	Physical Keyboards can sometimes be added (bluetooth)
	Mice are not an option
------------------------------------------
Applications
	Applications are called "Apps"
	Downloaded from an "App store"
	All apps for iOS must come from Apple's app store
		Closed/Single source
		Apple controls what apps can be run
		Limits choice, but also improves quality and eliminates malware
	Apps for android can come from several stores
		Open source
		Android, Amazon, Google, YAMM, many others
		More choices, but possibly not better...
------------------------------------------
Expandabilty
	Hardware is typically not upgradable
	Very limited connectivity 
	iOS devices have one proprietary connector for
		charger
		cameras (with special adapter)
		video mirroring (with special adapter)
	Android devices are similar
		Although they may also have microSD slots for added storage
	Bluetooth is common (for external kaeyboards)
------------------------------------------
Networking
	Network connectivity would be accomplished via
		802.11 (wireless LAN)
		Cellular (3g/4g)
			Typically requires additional account/charges via cell service provider (verizon/ATT/etc)
	Cloud backup/storage services are typically provided
------------------------------------------
Synchronization
	Mobile devices can sync with either
		local machines
		cloud based servers
	iOS devices sync with iTunes software (or iCloud)
		Music, Videos, Apps, and OS can all be backed up
	Android devices sync over internet
		Only some data is synced (calender, email, etc..)
		Device can also be treated as thumb drive and files moves with drag and drop
------------------------------------------
Security
	Mobile devices can easily be lost or stolen (they're mobile!)
	All can be protected with passcode (password) lock screen
	Mobile Devices can be remotely located and/or remotely wiped 
		iOS devices have this built in, works great
		Android devices have this as an optional app/feature to be installed
