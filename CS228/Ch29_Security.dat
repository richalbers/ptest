Security Issues
	Unauthorized Access
		Information
		Computers
		Networks
	Data Destruction
	Hardware Failures
	Malware

--------------------------------------------
Access Control
	Destroy Information 
		Prevents damage via dumpster diving
	Train Users to recognise Social Engineering
		Telephone Scams
		Phishing
	Secure Physical Access to prevent infiltration
		Lock Doors
			Train authorized users to avoid being tailgated
		Lock Computer Systems
			Unattended systems should have screen lock, requiring password to get access
		
--------------------------------------------
Access Control (continued)
	Authentication
		Password Policy
		Smart cards
		Biometric Devices
	File System Access
		Use NTFS (not FAT32)
		File Encryption
	Security Policies
		Local Security Policy
		Group Policy (domain)

--------------------------------------------
Common Security Policies
	Prevent Registry Edits
	Prevent access to the Command Prompt
	Log on Locally
	Shut System Down
	Minimum Password Length
	Account Lockout Threshold
	Disable Windows Installer
	Printer Browsing
--------------------------------------------
Event Logging
	Many security-related events get logged
		On Windows, the event viewer allows viewing the security logs
		Admins should review the logs periodically to check for security-related violations
	Auditing can be set up to log info about
		logons (valid and invalid) & Logoffs
		file accesses (attempted or successful)
	Incident reporting is part of an overall system that allows all security info to be gathered in one place

--------------------------------------------
Malicious Software
	Types
		Grayware
			Pop-ups
		Spyware - logs your activity
		Spam - unwanted email
		Virus - replicates/activates
		Worms - replicates over networks
		Macro - Run within apps that support macros
		Trojan Horses - Pretends to be something it's not
		Rootkit - conceals itself using low-level code
	Anti-virus Software
		Identify most malicious software by it's "signature"
		Must keep signature list current
--------------------------------------------
Virus Recovery
	Recognize
		Notice you have a problem
	Quarantine
		Keep it from spreading
	Search and Destroy
		Use anti-virus software to remove infection
	Remediate
		Repair any damage done
	Educate
		Instruct users on how to avoid installing malicious software
	
--------------------------------------------
Firewalls
	Firewalls block traffic based on ports/services  [[img http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5b/Firewall.png/300px-Firewall.png]] 
	Firewalls can be on individual computers or routers
		Use of both is recommended
	Windows 7 configures firewall and network services based on network type
		Home / Work
		Public Location
--------------------------------------------
Encryption
	Encryption is used anytime sensitive data needs to be sent across a possibly insecure network
	Kerberos is used when logging into a network (Windows Domain) 
	SSL / HTTPS are used for secure browsing
		This is based on Public/Private key encryption 
		Public key is delivered in digital certificate, which is signed b a trusted authority
	Wireless networking can be encrypted using WEP, WPA, or WPA2
--------------------------------------------
Wireless Security Concepts
	SSID broadcast
	Encryption
		WPA or WPA2
	Mac Address Filtering
	WAP Username and Password
