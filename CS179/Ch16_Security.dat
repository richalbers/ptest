Threats
	System Crashes
	Access Control Weaknesses
	Malware
	Social Engineering
	Denial of Service Attacks
	Physical Intrusion
	Rogue Access Points

-------------------------------------------
Malicious Software
	Malware - Any program designed to do something you don't want to have happen
	Virus - Attached to something, replicates and takes action
	Worm - Stand-alone program, replicates on it's own across network
	Trojan Horse - masquerades as something else
	Rootkit - Hides itself using low-level OS functions
	Adware - Displays unwanted ads
	Spyware - Sends info about your system over network

-------------------------------------------
More Bad Stuff
	Social Engineering
	Phishing
	Denial of Service Attack (DoS)
		Distributed DoS
		Botnets and Zombies
	Physical Intrusion
	Rogue Access Points

-------------------------------------------
Controlling User Access
	Important Concepts
		Authentication - Verifying a person is who they say they are
		Authorization - What operations is a user allowed to do
	User Accounts - Security starts here
		User accounts are used to control access to computer/network resources (programs, files, etc..)
		Use good passwords (or biometric devices)
		Restrict user rights
		Restrict file access to only that needed
			Use NTFS file system

-------------------------------------------
External Network Access
	Firewalls (network and personal)
		Port Filtering
		IP Filtering
	Hiding IPs (NAT)
	DMZ
	Internet vs Intranet

--------------------------------------------
Good Security Practices
	Control access
		Locks / Good Passwords
	Limit use of Admin Accounts
	Use Firewalls
	Use Antivirus software
	Keep OS updates current
	Use browser security features
	Use encryption
	Train your users to recognise potential security issues
