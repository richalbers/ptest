------------------------------------------
Introduction
	Wireless LANs allow computers to connect wirelessly to wireless access points
	Used to supplement wired networking
	Compared to wired, wireless is
		Not as fast
		Less reliable
		Less secure
	802.11g achieved widespread adoption
	802.11n is common
	802.11ac is the newest standard (not in book)

-------------------------------------------
Radio Transmission basics
	Radio waves are measured in Hz (cycles per second)
	Propagation Problems
		rapid inverse square law attenuation
		absorption
		multipath interference
		EMI
		Shadow zones (dead spots)
	Absorption attenuation and shadow zone problems increase with frequencies

-------------------------------------------
Frequency Spectrum
	Frequency spectum goes from zero Hz to infinity [[img http://www.ceessentials.net/images/rbpt6/image004.jpg ]]
	Spectrum has been divided into service bands allocated to different uses [[img http://donsnotes.com/tech/images/rf-spectrum.gif]]
		AM radio
		FM radio
		Televsion
		etc..
	Commercial Services operate between 800 MHz and 6 GHz [[img http://media.defenseindustrydaily.com/images/MISC_US_Frequency_Allocations_Chart_lg.jpg]]
	Most bands require a license to transmit on 
	WLANs use two "unlicensed" bands 
		2.4GHZ band 
		5 GHz band
-------------------------------------------
2.4 & 5 GHz bands
	2.4 GHz band
		Defined the same in all countries
		11-14 channels [[img http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8c/2.4_GHz_Wi-Fi_channels_%28802.11b%2Cg_WLAN%29.svg]]
		Only 3 are non-overlapping in US [[img http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/84/NonOverlappingChannels2.4GHzWLAN-en.svg]]
		Popularity of 2.4 GHz band means potential interference with other devices (microwaves, cordless phones, etc.)
	5 GHz band
		Higher frequencies allow more bandwidth
		[[Frequencies!http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_WLAN_channels ]] are non-standard worldwide
		14 possible channels, not all availabe in US, and channel width affects available channels
		Was more difficult to get good range 

--------------------------------------------
Spread Spectrum Transmission
	Spread Spectrum broadcasts data in small discrete chunks over differetn frequencies within a certain range
	Spread Spectrum Types
		Frequency Hopping (FHSS)
		Direct Sequence (DSSS)
		Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM)

------------------------------------------
Wireless Modes
	Infrastructure [[img http://static.commentcamarche.net/en.kioskea.net/pictures/wifi-images-infrastructure.gif]]
		Most common mode
		Utilizes Wireless Access Point (WAP) [[img http://images.wikia.com/infodepot/images/8/8a/Linksys_WAP54G.jpg]]
		Uses a Basic Service Set (BSS)
		Multiple WAPs can be used
			Extended Service Set
	Ad Hoc [[img http://www.wireless-router-net.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/ad-hoc-mode.gif]]
		Peer to Peer (no WAP)
		Uses IBSS (Independent BSS)

--------------------------------------------
802.11 standards
	802.11 (gone)
	802.11a
	802.11b
	802.11g
	802.11n
	802.11ac (new!  not in book)

--------------------------------------------
802.11a
	Utilizes DSSS in 5 GHz band
	Good throughput	
		rated: 54 Mpbs
		actual: well under 20 Mbps
	Poor range
	Products:
		shipped late (after 802.11b!)
		had poor performance
		were expensive
	Little market acceptance

-------------------------------------------
802.11b
	Utilizes DSSS in 2.4 GHz band
	Fair throughput 
		rated: 11 Mbps
		actual: 6 Mbps
	Decent range
	Products
		Shipped the same time as 802.11a
		Worked well
		had adequate performance
	Gained fairly broad acceptance

--------------------------------------------
802.11g
	Utilizes OFDM in 2.4 GHz band
	Good througput
		rated: 54 Mbps
		actual: 25 Mpbs @ 30m
	Products
		shipped on time
		worked well
		had good performance
	Widely adopted, still in wide use
	[[802.11g WAP Configuration Interface Example!http://ui.linksys.com/files/WAP54G/v3/3.01/Setup.htm]]

-------------------------------------------
802.11n
	Utilizes OFDM + MIMO
		MIMO - Multiple I/O (antennas)
	Uses both 2.4 and 5 GHz for backwards compatibilty
	Great throughput
		rated: 100-200 Mbps
	Products
		shipped before draft was finalized
		Widely adopted, market is still growing
	[[802.11n WAP Configuration Interface Example!http://ui.linksys.com/files/WAP610N/1.0.00/ap/wireless_basic.html]]
-------------------------------------------
802.11ac
	Operates in the 5gz band only
	Not mentioned in textbook, 
		[[wikipedia has info!http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_802.11ac]]
		[[As does this article!http://www.zdnet.com/the-five-things-you-need-to-know-about-gigabit-wi-fi-802-11ac-7000017112/]]
---------------------------------------------
Wireless Security
	Authentication
		Is the computer/person allowed to connect?
		Handled either via 
			authentiation Server (Radius Server)
			or pre-shared key (common key for everyone)
	Encryption
		Scrambling the data so intercepted messages can't be read
		When encryption methods are cracked, new ones are devised
	Additional measure:
		Mac Address Filtering
			Limits who can connect by MAC address

---------------------------------------------
Data Encryption
	WEP - Wired Equivalent Privacy
		40-128 bit key entered on clients and WAP
		Introduced in 1999, can now easily be cracked
	WPA - Wi-Fi Protected Access
		Enterprise
			Requires an authentication server, which distributes keys to each user
			Utilizes TKIP (Temporal Key Integrity Protocol)
		Personal (PSK) - Pre-Shared Key version
			Designed for home and small offices
			No authentication server required
			All users given same key
			Key is derived from passphrase	
				20+ random chars is best
	[[Security Configuration Interface Example!http://ui.linksys.com/files/WAP54G/v3/3.01/Setup.htm]] (After page loads, look at Wireless Security Tab)
---------------------------------------------		
Data Encryption (continued)
	WPA2 (802.11i)
		Enterprise
			Implements all mandatory elements of 802.11i
			Requires an authentication server, which distributes keys to each user
			Utilizes AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) in place of TKIP
			Considered fully secure (when using AES)
		Personal (PSK)
			Designed for home and small offices
			No authentication server required
			All users given same key
			Key is derived from passphrase
				20+ random chars is best

------------------------------------------
Misc
	Wireless Uses CSMA/CA 	[[img http://www.advancedtubularstore.com/catalog/WiFi%20Antenna.jpg]]
		Carrier Sense  		[[img http://www.caworldwifi.com/images/pattern_hg2406u.gif]]
		Multiple Access 	[[img http://pimages.solidsignal.com/TL-ANT2414A_medlrg.jpg]]
		Collision Avoidance 
	WAPs need power 
		most conveniently provided via POE (Power over Ethernet)
	Antenna types
		Omni-directional[[directional!https://www.google.com/search?q=directional+WIFI+antenna&hl=en&prmd=imvns&source=lnms&tbm=isch&ei=DgNVT9WfG47JiQKlvdm]]
