Network Models
	This presentation covers
		Why have have layered networking models
		OSI and TCP/IP model details
		How the TCP/IP model (reality) works
		IP and MAC address overview
		Common protocols 

--------------------------------------------
Why layered models?
	Networking is complicated. It addresses a large number of issues in both hardware and software.
		What message format will be used between a browser a server?
		How will garbled messages be handled?
		How will addressing be handled?
		How will I avoid sending two messages on the network cable at the same time?
		What will the digital signals on the wire look like?
	Complex problems are best solved by dividing them into many simpler problems
	So we use Layers
		Each layer handles it's particular responsibilities
		Each layer communicates with the same layer at the other end of the connection
		Each layer provides services to the layer above and utilizes services from the layer below

--------------------------------
OSI and TCP/IP models
	OSI Model [[img images/NetworkModels.png]]
		"Academic" model, not actually implemented
		Appears in many network courses (textbooks) and on many certification exams (Network+, Cisco, etc.)
		Contains 7 layers
	TCP/IP Model
		Used in real world
		Has many similarities to OSI Model
		Contains 4 layers (5 if you include the physical layer)
			The different textbook/author's models can be viewed [[at this link!http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_protocol_suite#Layer_names_and_number_of_layers_in_the_literature]]
			The differences are academic, and aren't that significant.  Do not be alarmed.

How it works
	Message originates at application layer [[img images/NetworkEncapsulation.png]]
	Header and Footer (maybe) are added
	Entire message (including header and footer) are passed down to next layer [[img http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c4/IP_stack_connections.svg/500px-IP_stack_connections.svg.png]]
	Message from upper layer (including header and footer) becomes the data for current layer
	Process repeats at each layer until we get to physical layer 
	Message is transmitted across the medium
	Message is received by recipient and passed back up the stack, unpacked as we go up

-------------------------------------------
Addresses
	There are two addresses we're concerned with
		The final destination
		The next stop along the way
	The network layer packet header contains the final destination address 
		It's an IP Address. For IPv4:
			It's 4 bytes, each usually written in base 10, . delimited 
			Each number can be 0-255
			e.g. 10.23.123.56
	The Link Layer frame header contains the address of the next stop along the way
		It's a Physical address.  For Ethernet:
			It's 6 bytes, written in hex, : or - delimited
			e.g. 00:50:56:C0:00:01 or 00-50-56-C0-00-01
			First three bytes specify vender

------------------------------------------
Protocols
	Protocols (i.e. standards) are rules which govern the exchange of messages between computers
	Each layer has protocols that specify how things look and work at that layer
	Some Common Protocols
		Application Layer
			HTTP, HTTPS, SMTP, FTP
		Transport Layer
			TCP, UDP
		Network Layer
			IP
