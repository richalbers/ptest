Why We Need Layer 3 Addresses and Protocols
	Issues
		There were (are) several different physical layers
			Ethernet, Token Ring, etc..
		A computer's LAN (i.e. location) can't be identified by it's physical layer address (makes routing impossible)
		The physical layer depends on broadcasts to find each other.  This won't work with huge numbers of computers over long distances
	Layer 3 & 4 facilitates different computers on different LANS with different data link/physical layers to communicate

---------------------------------
History
	There were once 4 common layer 3/4 suites
		TCP/IP (Unix)
		NetBeui (Microsoft)
		IPX/SPX (Novell)
		Appletalk (Apple)
	Key internet services (Email, then the Web) run on TCP/IP, and everyone wants/needs those services, so companies all dropped their suite in favor of TCP/IP

--------------------------------
Basic TCP/IP Properties
	IP Address
		provides unique address for each computer on network
		v4 addresses are a 4 byte "dotted quad" 
		for example: 145.62.1.36
	Subnet Mask
		Specifies which part of IP address is the network portion and which part is the host portion
		In classful addressing, 255's followed by 0's
	Gateway
		IP address of the router that packets destined for computers not on the LAN (local network) are sent
	All these properties are configured by the network admin
----------------------------------
Additional Properties
	DNS Server
		IP address of a computer that can determine the IP address of a computer given it's host name
		A computer typically has several DNS server addresses listed in case one is down..
---------------------------------
IP classes (Classful)
	Class A 
		IP: 1-126.h.h.h
		SN: 255.0.0.0
		126 networks, 16M+ H/N
	Class B
		128-191.n.h.h
		SN: 255.255.0.0
		16K Networks, 65K H/N
	Class C
		192-223.n.n.h
		SN: 255.255.255.0
		2M Networks, 256 H/N

--------------------------------
Private IPs
	Private IPs NEVER appear on the internet
	They're used only on private networks
	Computers using them MUST use NAT to connect to the internet
	Class A
		10.0.0.0-10.255.255.255
	Class B
		172.16.0.0-172.31.255.255
	Class C
		192.168.0.0-192.168.255.255
--------------------------------
Classful Addressing Problems
	Classes weren't flexible enough
		There were too few Class A and B networks
		Class A and B networks provided too many hosts
		Class C didn't allow enough hosts
	Solutions
		CIDR (Classless InterDomain Routing) 
		NAT (Network Address Translation)
		IPv6 (IP, version 6)
--------------------------------
CIDR 	
	Allows the break between Network and Host to occur somewhere other than a .
	Resulting subnet masks (when written in Base 10), don't have just 255s and 0s.
	Notation
		IP Address/bits in subnet mask
		For Example:
			12.34.0.0/16
			190.24.56.0/24
	CIDR and Subnetting are covered in more detail in CS229

--------------------------------
Static Vs Dynamic Addresses
	Static
		Addresses that don't change
		Used by Servers, Printers, etc..
	Dynamic
		Addresses that can change
		Used by client machines
		Typically assigned via DHCP Server
		Or, more rarely, by APIPA (Automatic Private IP Addressing) process
			Assigns 169.254.x.x address

--------------------------------
Application Layer Protocols
	The following are common application layer protocols
		SMTP - Simple Mail Transport Protocol 
		POP - Post Office Protocol
		FTP - File Transport Protocol
		HTTP - HyperText Transfer Protocol
		HTTPS - Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure
		SNMP - Simple Network Management Protocol
	There are many many more...

--------------------------------
Other Layer Protocols
	Transport
		TCP - Transmission Control Protocol
		UDP - User Datagram Protocol
	Network
		IP - Internet Protocol
	Network/Datalink
		ARP - Address Resolution Protocol

--------------------------------
Commands
	IPConfig
	Ping
	TraceRt (trace route)
	arp
