------------------------------------------
DataComm Overview
	Data Communications involves sending digital messages from one device to another external device
	As distance increases, accurate transmission becomes more difficult
	Data comm systems seek to maximize the transmission rate at the lowest power and least noise
------------------------------------------
Common Datacomm Terms
	Analog vs Digital	[[img images/AnalogDigital.gif]]
	Amplitude, Frequency, and Wavelength [[img images/Wave.gif]]
	Propagation [[img images/Attenuation.png]]
	Attenuation
	Noise

------------------------------------------
Background
	Data in computer systems is stored, transmitted, and processed as binary  [[img images/Win7CalcBin.jpg]]
	Data must be stored and transmitted with 100% accuracy
	Digital systems allow us to maintain that accuracy
		Numbers are stored as binary numbers [[img https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/85/ASCII_Code_Chart-Quick_ref_card.jpg/800px-ASCII_Code_Chart-Quick_ref_card.jpg]]
		For text, the most common format is UTF-8, which is backwards compatible with [[ASCII!http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:ASCII_Code_Chart-Quick_ref_card.jpg]]), an encoding method that goes back to the 60's.
		Changing a single bit  
			Can change a bank balance from $1 to $2,097,153 dollars
			Can change a name from Tim to Dim

------------------------------------------
Channels
	Signal travels from source to destination [[img images/SimplexDuplex.jpg]]
	Channel is a pathway over which signals travel	
	Channels have Direction associated with them  [[img images/BasebandBroadband.gif]]
		Simplex - only one direction
		Half Duplex - both directions, one at a time
		Full Duplex - both directions at same time
	Mediums (wires, fiber, air, etc.) can support one or more channels 
		Baseband devotes the entire capacity of the medium to one communication channel.
		Broadband enables two or more communication channels to share the bandwidth of the communications medium.
	Bandwidth (maxiumum data rate) of channel is measured in bits per second (Kbps, Mbps)
	
-------------------------------------------
Serial Communication
	A single channel can carry only one bit at a time [[img images/ParallelSerialComm.gif]]
	To send 8 bits at one time would require 8 channels
		For short distances this is economically feasible
			e.g. moving data inside a computer from the CPU to memory 
		For long distances, it's not
			e.g. transmitting data across a room/city/country
	So dataComm systems use serial communication
    
--------------------------------------------
Async vs Sync
	Both send and receiver need to know when the message progresses from bit to the next
	Synchronous systems [[img images/commSync.gif]]
		Require the sender and receiver to use the same clock, so the timing signals must also be sent
		This usually requires another channel
	Asynchronous systems [[img images/commAsync.gif]]
		Both sender and receiver have their own nearly-identical clocks
		A "start" bit is sent to sync up the clocks and then a short message
		Clocks need to be re-synced often to assure accuracy

--------------------------------------------
Parity and Checksums
	Noise can affect data transmission (flipping bits) [[img images/noise.gif]]
	Parity and/or Checksums can be used to verify data integrity
	Parity 				[[img images/parity.jpg]]
		Adds a bit to each byte
		Each byte can then be verified for accuracy
		Types: Odd, Even
	Checksum 		[[img images/GenerateChecksum.bmp]]
		Adds a mathematically computed number to the end of the message
		Entire message can then be verified for accuracy
	Data found in error can be retransmitted

---------------------------------------
Practice
	Assuming we're using odd parity, which of these are in error?
		100000001
		100001000
		101010101
		110110110
		000000000
	Using [[this online checksum generator!http://onlinemd5.com/]]
		generate a checksum for a file
		make a minor change to the file (Changing a capital letter to a lowercase letter is a 1-bit change)
		regenerate the checksum
		Is it different?
---------------------------------------
Compression and Encryption
	Compression - Mathematically altering the data so fewer bits need to be sent [[img images/compression.gif]]
		All compression methods used in data comm are lossless. 
	Encryption - Mathematically altering the data so contents are unintelligible en-route [[img images/encryption.png]]

---------------------------------------------
Modulation
	Modifying an analog carrier wave to carry a message [[img images/modulation.jpg]]
	Types
		AM - Amplitude Modulation
		FM - Frequency Modulation
		PM - Phase Modulation
